Notes about tests:
- Almost all tests tell me that FUSE class has no attribute named 'Operations'
- The functions that are instantiation methods requiere another parameter it says that it needs N parameters (N-1 given) because of the 'self' parameter
- When trying to compute the function 'get_children' it tells me that it can not iterate over None object even though via code
I check wether the list that is returned is empty or not before iterating over it but it raises that error regardless of the outcome of the conditional.
 
Functions that were refactored:
- Write function added entirely.
- Chmod function refactored given Raul specifications.
- Chown function refactores given Raul specifications.
- Unit test modules refactores given Raul specifications.
- Test for a given order of functions added.
